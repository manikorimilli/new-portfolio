                I&apos;m a passionate software engineer from Hyderabad who
                loves turning ideas into reality through code — fast, live,
                and quietly intelligent.

                My path started with a CS degree, a detour through training AI
                models, then full-time product engineering. Each step taught
                me something the next one needed — evaluating LLMs made me
                precise about quality, building chatbot platforms sharpened my
                instincts for reliability, and shipping analytics at DeeptaAI
                taught me that the best engineering is invisible until you
                notice how fast a decision became.
